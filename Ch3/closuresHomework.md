#### *'A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.'*   

#### *'Closure — A function that is a first-class citizen and has access to variables local to the scope in which it was defined.'*   

##### *'Whenever a function is defined inside another function, the inner function will have access to any variables that are declared in the outer.'*

### Conclusions  
Variables from outer functions are available inside without having to pass them.
This is somewhat unique to javascript. The lexical environment created when a
function is defined is accessible by functions and expression within that given
scope.
